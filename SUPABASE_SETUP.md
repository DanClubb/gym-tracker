# Supabase Setup Guide for Gym Tracker

This guide will walk you through setting up Supabase for your gym tracker application.

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Fill in the project details:
    - **Name**: `gym-tracker` (or your preferred name)
    - **Database Password**: Create a strong password (save this!)
    - **Region**: Choose the closest region to your users
5. Click "Create new project"
6. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few minutes)

## Step 2: Get Your Project Credentials

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
2. Copy the following values:
    - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
    - **anon public** key (starts with `eyJ`)

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

2. Add the following content to `.env.local`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials from Step 2.

## Step 4: Set Up the Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click "New query"
3. Copy the entire content from `supabase/schema.sql` in your project
4. Paste it into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" to execute the schema

This will create:

-   All necessary tables (users, exercises, workout_templates, etc.)
-   Row Level Security (RLS) policies
-   Triggers for user management
-   Initial exercise data

## Step 5: Configure Authentication

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Under **Site URL**, add: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Under **Redirect URLs**, add: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
4. Save the changes

## Step 6: Test the Connection

1. Start your development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. You should see the authentication form
4. Try creating an account to test the connection

## Step 7: Verify Database Setup

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Table Editor**
2. You should see the following tables:
    - `users`
    - `exercises` (with initial data)
    - `workout_templates`
    - `workout_exercises`
    - `workout_sessions`
    - `workout_sets`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Your project's URL and API key are required"**

    - Make sure your `.env.local` file exists and has the correct values
    - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **Authentication errors**

    - Verify your Site URL and Redirect URLs are correct in Supabase Auth settings
    - Make sure you're using the `anon` key, not the `service_role` key

3. **Database connection errors**
    - Ensure the schema was executed successfully in the SQL Editor
    - Check that all tables were created

### Environment Variables Reference:

```env
# Required for the app to work
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# Optional - for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## Next Steps

Once Supabase is connected:

1. Test user registration and login
2. Create your first workout template
3. Start logging workouts
4. Check that progressive overload recommendations work

Your gym tracker should now be fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
